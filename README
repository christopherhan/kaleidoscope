How It Works
-----------------
Listens to the real-time Twitter stream for any Instagram links. 
Parses out the Media ID, and sends a request to Instagram for the 
photo and related information.

This is purely experimental. Obviously, polling Instagram on every 
request is extremely inefficient. Instagram has a real-time API, but 
subscribing to many geographies can be cumbersome since it only allows 
up to a 5000 meter radius.
